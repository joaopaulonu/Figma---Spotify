# Figma---Spotify

This project is a design exercise focused on recreating the Spotify user interface using Figma. The goal was to understand and apply principles of responsive design, visual hierarchy, and usability. It includes detailed design files, interactive prototypes, and a breakdown of the design decisions made to enhance the user experience (UX) and visual aesthetics.
